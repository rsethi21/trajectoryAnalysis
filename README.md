Original trajectory data are available in

 (from Bin Sun)

## Timeseries Forecasting
Currently will output time series Radgyr, RMSD, WaterShell, IonShell from pytraj

Could not pip install pytraj, needed to build locally; follow their instructions

Multi-variate, multi-output, multi-step, multi-dataset LSTM training on traj3, 7 with 15 copies each
pH 3 has 722 frames, pH 7 has 682 frames

Multiprocessed by number of structures, approximate runtime was about 17 for 1 structure copy, 21 for 4 structure copies, and 45 for 15 structure copies

Workflow pylint

## Read this notebook first 
prelim.ipynb - very basic notebook for loading two simulation cases (trajs3 and trajs7) that correspond to an ensemble of proteins simulated at different pHs. Once the files are loaded as pandas dataframes, they are run through a decision-tree classification algorithm. Further details are provided inside the ipynb document. 

trajs3_scored.csv - feature file with classification (isFolded) for proteins simulated at pH 3 
trajs3_scored.csv - feature file with classification (isFolded) for proteins simulated at pH 7 

## To prepare data 
processSimulations.py - this file generates the csv from simulation data. PKH needs to run this, since I have the input simulation files

1. process
python3 processSimulations.py -generate -nstruct 99 -case traj3
python3 processSimulations.py -generate -nstruct 99 -case traj7    
2. postprocess 
python3 processSimulations.py -postprocess -nstruct 99 -case traj3
python3 processSimulations.py -postprocess -nstruct 99 -case traj7
